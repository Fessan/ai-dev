Synced from rules/lite.md.

Quick Start:
1. Read INSTRUCTIONS.md
2. Read context.md for stack, commands, structure
3. If unclear, ask and wait

Rules:
- Simple task (1-3 files): clarify if needed → code
- Complex task: mini-plan → approval → code
- Tests required for: payments, auth, user data
- Tests optional for: CRUD, UI, utilities

Agents (on request):
- code-developer, code-reviewer, security-auditor, secret-scanner

Principles:
- KISS — simplicity first
- YAGNI — don't add "for the future"
- DRY — don't repeat

Auto-update context.md after significant changes.
