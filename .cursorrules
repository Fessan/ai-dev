Synced from rules/core.md and rules/workflow.md.

Core:
- Follow INSTRUCTIONS.md.
- Use the correct agent and state which agent/skills are active.
- Do not assume stack/commands; read files.
- Ask questions if unclear; wait for answers.
- Avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested.

Workflow:
1) Read INSTRUCTIONS.md and the relevant agent file.
2) Read .claude/guides/.
3) Find real stack/run/test commands from config files.
4) Before any file changes: provide a 5–9 step mini-plan, include the
   Implementation Checklist, and wait for explicit approval.
5) TDD is mandatory: test (RED) → code (GREEN) → refactor → re-run tests.
6) After code-developer, always run code-reviewer.
7) Update guides and DECISIONS.md when triggers apply.
